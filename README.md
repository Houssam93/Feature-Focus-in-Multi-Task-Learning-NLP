# Multitask learning for discovering semantic relations between words

The repository contains the code used for Learning Lexical-Semantic Relations, this paper is published in the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Findings)




## Data
The data of the paper are on the `data` directory. The notebook also assumes access to the [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), in particular [these embeddings](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip).

not after each batch. This issue will be improved in future relases
